        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p> 1. This project is consisting of two python-based 2D games, shooting game and car game Developed using the pygame library, integrated with a SQL server 
            database for player data Management. The shooting game is a space-themed shooter where the player controls a spaceship to Destroy incoming enemies, featuring 
            dynamic scoring, sound effects, and a replay system. The car Game is a lane-based racing game where the layer avoids incoming vehicles, with increasing difficulty and 
            collision detection. Both games utilize a database (GameDB) to store and retrieve player information, including username and password, high scores, enabling features 
            like player authentication, high score tracking, and demonstrate core game development concepts such as sprite management, collision detection, and event 
            handling, while showcasing database integration for data persistence and user management.<br>
            2. The user interacts with the system through a seamless interface that provides access to multiple games and functionalities. The system requires the user to 
               register through a signup process, creating a unique identity with a username and password, ensuring secure access. Upon successful login, the user is directed to a game 
               selection screen, where they can choose between the Shooting Game and the Car Game. The user’s progress, such as high scores, is tracked and stored in the database, enabling 
               personalized experiences. In the Shooting Game, the user controls a spaceship to eliminate enemies, while in the Car Game, the user navigates a car through traffic, 
               avoiding collisions. Each game offers increasing difficulty levels, testing the user’s skills and reflexes. Real-time feedback is provided through score updates and game
               over prompts. The system handles user inputs like arrow keys for movement and key presses for restarting the game after a loss. Additionally, the user’s performance is 
               recorded, allowing high scores to be retrieved and updated automatically. The interface is designed to be intuitive, making the gaming experience smooth and engaging. The 
               user benefits from a personalized profile, game progress tracking, and score management. Overall, the system offers a dynamic gaming experience where the user 
               can seamlessly switch between games, challenge themselves, and improve their performance over time.<br>

                    <p>1. This is the login screen where users enter their credentials to start the game. It was built using Pygame GUI elements.<br>
                       2. Players must log in before starting the game. The system ensures that each player has a unique username<br> 
                       3. User must enter a valid username that exists in the database to log in. If an incorrect username is entered, the system denies access.<br>
                       4. After logging in, players are directed to the game selection screen.<br> 
                       5. After login, the player's username is displayed on the selection screen. This ensures that each player knows they are logged into the correct account </p>
